ðŸ“Œ 1. Memory Optimization Flow (Pre- and Post-Placement Stages)
âœ… Pre-Placement Stage:

Analyzed memory footprint of design blocks.

Identified high-utilization areas for early optimization.

Reviewed synthesis reports to understand logic replication and resource mapping.

Revisited floorplanning guidelines to avoid memory fragmentation.

âœ… Post-Placement Stage:

Checked placement utilization metrics and congestion maps.

Verified memory macro placement constraints were met.

Ensured no overlap of critical paths through memory blocks.

Reviewed timing and power impact after placement.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Verilog Practice on EDA Playground

Simulated basic combinational and sequential circuits.

Reviewed Verilog constructs (always, assign, initial, sensitivity lists).

Ran testbenches to verify behavior of flip-flops, mux, and encoders.

Compared simulation waveforms with expected outputs for verification.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Python Practice (LeetCode, HackerRank)

Practiced algorithm questions focused on:

String manipulation

List operations

Hash maps and sets

Solved edge-case problems to reinforce concepts

Reviewed time/space complexity of different solutions
