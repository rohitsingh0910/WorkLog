1. Immutability â†’ Simpler Internal Structure

Tuple is immutable (unchangeable after creation).

List is mutable (you can add, remove, or change elements).

ðŸ”§ Because tuples are immutable:

Python doesn't need to maintain extra bookkeeping (like size changes).

Memory allocation is simpler and more compact.

No need to allocate extra memory space for growth (as with lists).

2. Less Overhead

Tuples require less memory than lists.

Since tuples can't change, Python can optimize their internal representation.

3. Faster Iteration

Tuples can be iterated slightly faster than lists because there's no need to check for mutations.

This makes operations like looping or accessing elements slightly faster.


Dictionaries are ordered as of Python 3.7+ (officially in 3.7, guaranteed in 3.8+)


Comprehensions are faster than traditional loops because:

They're implemented in C under the hood (CPython)

They avoid function calls and append() method overhead

They run in a tight, optimized loop

Comprehensions condense a loop + append into one expression, reducing:

Code execution time

Function call overhead

Context switching between Python bytecode operations
