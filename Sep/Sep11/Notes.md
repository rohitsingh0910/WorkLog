Cisco pyATS Framework:
- pyATS (Python Automated Test System) is Cisco’s testing framework for network automation.
- It enables automated testing of network devices through CLI or APIs.
- Testbeds are defined in YAML, specifying devices, credentials, and connections.
- Genie is a pyATS library used for parsing command outputs into structured data (JSON/dict).
- Tests are written in AEtest format using Python classes and methods.
- pyATS supports simulation, validation, regression, and continuous testing.
- It integrates easily with CI/CD pipelines via CLI or Jenkins.
- Example use cases: interface verification, BGP/OSPF neighbor checks, device health.

vTest Overview:
- vTest is an execution environment built around pyATS for network testing.
- It adds features like UI dashboards, logging, result management, and test orchestration.
- vTest simplifies managing large-scale test environments.
- It provides integration hooks for enterprise automation workflows and reporting.
- Often used in conjunction with pyATS for end-to-end network validation.

OSI Model (7 Layers):
1. Physical – Transmits raw bits (cables, connectors, voltages).
2. Data Link – Error-free transfer between two directly connected nodes (MAC, switches).
3. Network – Handles routing and IP addressing (routers, IP, ICMP).
4. Transport – Ensures reliable delivery (TCP, UDP, flow control).
5. Session – Manages sessions and connections (establishment/termination).
6. Presentation – Data translation, encryption, compression (MIME, SSL).
7. Application – Interface to user applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP).

TCP/IP Model (4 Layers):
1. Link – Combines OSI’s Physical and Data Link layers (Ethernet, ARP).
2. Internet – Maps to OSI’s Network layer (IP, ICMP).
3. Transport – Same as OSI’s Transport layer (TCP, UDP).
4. Application – Merges OSI’s top 3 layers (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).

Python Concepts for Practice:
- List/Array manipulation: slicing, reversing, merging, filtering.
- Dictionary/hashmap usage for counting, grouping, and mapping.
- String methods: split, join, replace, regex for parsing text.
- Sorting algorithms and custom key-based sorting (lambda).
- Two-pointer techniques for array problems (e.g. Two Sum, Palindromes).
- Recursion and backtracking (DFS, N-Queens).
- Time & space complexity analysis (Big O notation).

Note: Cisco's pyATS and vTest together enable scalable, automated network validation—especially useful in large enterprise or data center environments.
