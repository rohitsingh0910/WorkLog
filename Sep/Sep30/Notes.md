1. Pre-Placement Optimization (PPO) in RTL Design

Pre-Placement Optimization refers to the set of optimizations performed on the RTL and synthesized netlist before physical placement in the ASIC/FPGA design flow.

The goal is to improve timing, area, and power metrics early, so that placement and routing become easier and more effective.

PPO techniques include:

Logic restructuring: Reorganizing combinational logic to reduce delay paths.

Gate sizing: Adjusting cell sizes to optimize drive strength for timing critical paths.

Buffer insertion/removal: Adding buffers to break long nets or removing unnecessary buffers.

Path pruning: Removing redundant or unreachable logic.

By optimizing early, the place-and-route tools have a simpler and more optimized design to work on, leading to better final results.

PPO also includes efforts to minimize congestion and improve routability by balancing logic and placement constraints.

Tools typically run static timing analysis (STA) iteratively during PPO to identify critical paths for targeted optimization.

2. Zero RC Optimization

Zero RC optimization focuses on the removal of zero resistance and zero capacitance elements in the design netlist.

Such zero RC elements often occur due to:

Logical reconvergence that leads to nets without load.

Buffers or cells with no effective delay (e.g., zero resistance).

Redundant cells inserted during synthesis or optimization phases.

These zero RC paths can create false timing paths or invalid delays in static timing analysis.

Optimization removes or merges these zero RC elements to:

Prevent timing analysis errors.

Simplify the netlist for place and route.

Reduce unnecessary power consumption.

Techniques include:

Merging zero resistance nets.

Eliminating buffers with no delay impact.

Cleaning up nets with zero capacitance loads.

This cleanup step is crucial because zero RC paths can mask real timing violations or cause inaccurate timing closure.

3. Techniques for Removing Unnecessary Delays

Unnecessary delays can be introduced in RTL or during synthesis due to over-conservative timing assumptions or redundant logic.

Methods to reduce these delays include:

Path-based optimization: Identify non-critical or false paths and remove or constrain them.

Logic restructuring: Simplify logic expressions and reduce logic levels.

Retiming: Moving flip-flops across combinational logic to balance delays.

Buffer optimization: Remove buffers that don’t contribute to delay improvement.

Clock gating optimization: Eliminate gating that adds unnecessary latency.

Tools provide delay cleanup passes that remove or consolidate delays that do not affect functionality.

Accurate delay removal improves overall timing margins and reduces design pessimism.

4. Linting in RTL Design

Linting is a static code analysis process performed on RTL code (Verilog/VHDL) to detect potential coding issues, bugs, and coding standard violations.

It’s analogous to code linting in software development but specific to hardware design.

Objectives:

Find syntax errors.

Detect race conditions and inferred latches.

Identify illegal or non-synthesizable constructs.

Enforce coding style and best practices.

Benefits:

Early bug detection before simulation or synthesis.

Improved design quality and maintainability.

Reduced risk of downstream issues in place-and-route or timing closure.

Common checks:

Undriven signals or nets.

Multiple drivers on a single net.

Uninitialized registers.

Incomplete case statements.

Sensitivity list mismatches.

Popular RTL linting tools: Synopsys SpyGlass, Mentor Graphics Questa Lint, Cadence JasperGold.

Linting reports usually categorize errors, warnings, and informational messages.

Integrating linting into CI pipelines ensures continuous code quality monitoring.

5. Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) Checks

CDC refers to signals that pass from one clock domain to another clock domain that may be asynchronous or have different clock frequencies.

Improper handling of CDC can cause metastability and data corruption.

CDC checks ensure the design correctly handles these crossings with:

Synchronizers.

FIFOs.

Handshaking logic.

CDC verification tools analyze the RTL or netlist to:

Detect clock domains.

Identify signals crossing domains.

Verify appropriate synchronization structures exist.

Common CDC issues found by tools:

Missing synchronizers on control signals.

Incorrect data width handling in FIFOs.

Asynchronous resets crossing clock domains.

CDC checkers generate reports with categorized issues:

Critical (must fix).

Warnings (potential risk).

Informational.

CDC verification complements linting and static timing analysis for robust design reliability.

CDC is especially important in complex SoCs with multiple clock domains (e.g., CPU, peripherals, IO).

6. Additional Notes and Best Practices

PPO should be performed iteratively with STA feedback to ensure improvements are effective.

Zero RC cleanup should be automated in the design flow to avoid manual errors.

Consistent linting before synthesis saves time by catching issues early.

CDC checks are mandatory in multi-clock designs and must be part of signoff criteria.

Keeping RTL clean and modular simplifies PPO and CDC verification.

Collaboration between design, verification, and physical design teams enhances optimization quality.

Design for testability (DFT) and power optimizations should also be considered alongside PPO.
