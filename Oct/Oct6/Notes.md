Factory Method Design Pattern
This pattern is typically helpful when it's necessary to separate the construction of an object from its implementation.
With the use of this design pattern, objects can be produced without having to define the exact class of object to be created.
Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern
Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
